            "CVE-2019-16065": "A remote SQL injection web vulnerability was discovered in the Enigma NMS 65.0.0 and prior web application that allows an attacker to execute SQL commands to expose and compromise the web server, expose database tables and values, and potentially execute system-based commands as the mysql user. This affects the search_pattern value of the manage_hosts_short.cgi script.",
            "CVE-2019-15635": "An issue was discovered in Grafana 5.4.0. Passwords for data sources used by Grafana (e.g., MySQL) are not encrypted. An admin user can reveal passwords for any data source by pressing the 'Save and test' button within a data source's settings menu. When watching the transaction with Burp Proxy, the password for the data source is revealed and sent to the server. From a browser, a prompt to save the credentials is generated, and the password can be revealed by simply checking the 'Show password' box.",
            "CVE-2019-14939": "An issue was discovered in the mysql (aka mysqljs) module 2.17.1 for Node.js. The LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE option is open by default.",

            "CVE-2019-13021": "The administrative passwords for all versions of Bond JetSelect are stored within an unprotected file on the filesystem, rather than encrypted within the MySQL database. This backup copy of the passwords is made as part of the installation script, after the administrator has generated a password using ENCtool.jar (see CVE-2019-13022). This allows any low-privilege user who can read this file to trivially obtain the passwords for the administrative accounts of the JetSelect application. The path to the file containing the encoded password hash is /opt/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general-properties.",
            "CVE-2019-12831": "In MyBB before 1.8.21, an attacker can abuse a default behavior of MySQL on many systems (that leads to truncation of strings that are too long for a database column) to create a PHP shell in the cache directory of a targeted forum via a crafted XML import, as demonstrated by truncation of aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.php.css to aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.php with a 30-character limit, aka theme import stylesheet name RCE.",
            "CVE-2019-12086": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.",
            "CVE-2019-11271": "Cloud Foundry BOSH 270.x versions prior to v270.1.1, contain a BOSH Director that does not properly redact credentials when configured to use a MySQL database. A local authenticated malicious user may read any credentials that are contained in a BOSH manifest.",
            "CVE-2019-10855": "Computrols CBAS 18.0.0 mishandles password hashes. The approach is MD5 with a pw prefix, e.g., if the password is admin, it will calculate the MD5 hash of pwadmin and store it in a MySQL database.",
            "CVE-2019-10752": "Sequelize, all versions prior to version 4.44.3 and 5.15.1, is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to sequelize.json() helper function not escaping values properly when formatting sub paths for JSON queries for MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite.",
            "CVE-2019-10748": "Sequelize all versions prior to 3.35.1, 4.44.3, and 5.8.11 are vulnerable to SQL Injection due to JSON path keys not being properly escaped for the MySQL/MariaDB dialects.",
            "CVE-2019-1010259": "SaltStack Salt 2018.3, 2019.2 is affected by: SQL Injection. The impact is: An attacker could escalate privileges on MySQL server deployed by cloud provider.
