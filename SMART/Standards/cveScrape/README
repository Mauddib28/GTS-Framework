The script in this directory 'cveScraper.sh' is meant to format copy paste data from NIST NVD website
	into a format that can be more easily incorporated into TAMSAT + SMART

TAMSAT:
	- Merge with TAMSAT vulnsDb.json file under the correct solution (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB, CouchDB)		[cveJSON.txt]
		- Add necessary spaces (12?) to format data for easy human-readable
		- Nota Bene: Make sure to add entried under the correct item/solution
	- Nota Bene: Will require some additional troubleshooting to remove special/escape characters
		from the JSON file
		- This prevents issues when trying to parse the JSON Datbase

SMART:
	- Run the following commands with the 'cveGrab.py' script						[cveList.txt]
		python -i cveGrab.py
		>> cveList = cveFile2List("filename")
		>> genCVErisk(cveList)
	- Merge the output riskValDb.json into the appropriate SMART riskValDb.json file
